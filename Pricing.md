# Seal pricing

- **Choose your own key server providers:** Seal supports a decentralized network of independent key servers. Builders can select any combination of providers to form their preferred threshold configuration for encryption and decryption.
- **Transparent pricing & features:** Each key server provider sets their own pricing and rate limits based on their service model. Builders can evaluate and choose based on what best fits their application needs.
- **Curated discoverability:** This documentation will list a verified set of providers along with available links to their configuration details, terms, and pricing, so you can integrate with confidence.
